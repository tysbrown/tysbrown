### I ship code. Primarily in TypeScript.

Functional programming is my jam.

The web is my domain. 

I love building features end-to-end. Client, server, and database.

Currently a slave to React, Node, and GraphQL.

```javascript
const tyler = {
  languages: ["javascript", "typescript"],
  frameworks: ["react", "next", "vite", "remix", "express"],
  databases: ["postgresql", "mongoDB", "prisma"],
  api: ["graphQL", "REST"],
  styles: ["tailwind", "emotion", "scss"],
  testing: ["jest", "react-testing-library", "playwright"],
  cms: ["sanity"]
}
```
