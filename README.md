## Tyler Brown // Front-End Engineer in Orlando. &nbsp;🧑🏼‍💻☕️
#### <i>I build useable, performant, accessible UIs with clean, maintainable code.</i>

While my official job title is <i>Front-End Engineer</i>, I consider myself to be specifically a JavaScript Engineer and spend my days writing React and TypeScript. My work is currently mostly focused within Jamstack, namely Gatsby, NextJS, and Sanity.
