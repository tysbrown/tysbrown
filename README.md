## Tyler Brown // Front-End Engineer in Orlando. &nbsp;🧑🏼‍💻☕️
#### <i>I build useable, performant, accessible UIs with clean, maintainable code.</i>

I'm best described as a JavaScript Engineer and spend my days writing React and TypeScript. At work, I build UIs with Jamstack, namely Gatsby, NextJS, and headless content management systems. On my own time, I like to explore the back-end world of JS with Node and Express.
